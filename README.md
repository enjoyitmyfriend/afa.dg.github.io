Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* Here is the demo of HTML<br>
http://afadg.cn/Website_Design/Metta/index.html

* You can change the last second part behind the / to open your webpage where there has a folder named after you stored all your materials
<br>e.g. http://afadg.cn/Website_Design/Lucas/index.html
<br>e.g. http://afadg.cn/Website_Design/Dan/index.html
* Only support access to those who have already uploaded their files to the database.


* I bought the domain server so that you could visit your webpage online by etonhouse-dg.top, but one day it will expire so at that time you should use the original address to access the webpage.
<br>e.g. http://afadg.github.io/webpage_design/Lucas/index.html
